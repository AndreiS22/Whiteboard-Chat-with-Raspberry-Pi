# Whiteboard-Chat-with-Raspberry-Pi
##### Made in collaboration with Oliver Enrico
### In this project, we programmed two Raspberry Pis to communicate and run a whiteboard GUI. Users can draw an image on the whiteboard interface running on one Raspberry Pi and would be able to see the same image being reproduced in real time on the other Rapsberry Pi. 
### This project features:
   * The QT framework for the GUI
   * QThreads for managing the app's threads
   * WiringPi for manipulating the Pis' GPIO
### It also includes a simple custom communication protocol that is based on a data line and two confirmation lines, one from the sender Pi and one from the receiver Pi.
